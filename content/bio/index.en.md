I was born 2004 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and grew up in a German-French family. At the age of three, I entered the Deutsche Schule Las Palmas and remained there until my high school graduation in 2022.

Starting in 2008, I received piano lessons at the Conservatorio Arenas Albéniz. For the first ten years, I was taught by Purificación Padilla, and later I switched to Volodymyr Kotenko. I really enjoy playing the piano, especially music by Chopin, Beethoven, and Bach. For a while, I participated in competitions (also with my sister Camille) and even managed to become a federal prize holder of "Jugend Musiziert". I concluded my piano education at Arenas Albéniz in June 2022 with a recital. The recordings of the pieces played there can be listened to [here]({{< ref "/music" >}}).

In 2020, during the pandemic, I discovered computer science for myself through the online course [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), which I highly recommended. As a final project, I created this website. I occasionally update its content and some [technical aspects]({{< ref "/" >}}). In the 20/21 school year, I participated in the Federal Computer Science Competition and made it to the final round. The endless amount of possible applications of computer science and my joy in problem-solving led me to start studying IT-Systems Engineering at the <abbr title="Hasso-Plattner-Institute">HPI</abbr> in Potsdam in the fall of 2022.

The study also takes up the majority of my time. Alongside, I do my best to maintain my piano playing, engage in activities with my friends, go to the gym and like to ride my gravelbike.
