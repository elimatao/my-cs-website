I was born 2004 in Las Palmas and grew up in a franco-german family. At the age of three, I entered the kindergarten of the German School and stayed there for the remaining levels.

Generally, I prefered the scientific subjects such as the project-oriented "STEM", physics and math. I won prizes in different math competitions. In May 2022, I graduated from school with a 1.0 (A-level).

Starting from 2008 I received piano lessons in the Arenas-Albéniz conservatory. My first teacher was Purificación Padilla. Ten years later, I switched to Volodymyr Kotenko. I enjoy playing the piano, specially romantic composers like Chopin or Mendelssohn, but also Bach, Beethoven and some composers of the 20th century. I won multiple prizes in different music competitions (also with my little sister Camille, who plays the chello), even managing to become a federal price holder of "Jugend Musiziert". I concluded my piano education in June 2022 with a recital. The recordings of the pieces played there can be listened to [here]({{< ref "/music" >}}).

2020 I discovered informatics through the recommendable online-course [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). As final project I built this website. It eventually became more than that and is being enhanced and updated from time to time. In the 20/21 course I participated in the federal informatics competition and managed to reach the final round, where I was cut into pieces.

I find informatics to be fascinating because of its countless possibilities of being applied. Aditionally, the activity of building software is quite fulfilling. All this led me to start studying this subject in fall 2022.

Apart from all this I spend my free time doing sports, playing with my dog Balloo and my Cats Max and Moritz or reading. Lastly I've specifically enjoyed reading fantasy novels written by Colfer, Funke, Tolkien and Zafón, but also classics from Dumas and London.

Ocasionally I do some gaming, mostly RPGs (Assassin’s Creed, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher, Hitman, Watch Dogs, etc.) and multiplayer shooters (PUBG, Valorant).
