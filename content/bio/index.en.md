Currently, I'm a student of the German School in Las Palmas and the Conservatorio Profesional de Música Arenas-Albéniz, where I study the piano and harmonic analysis with Volodymyr Kotenko.

I was born 2004 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. From the beginning, my parents spoke to me in German and French. At the age of three, I entered the kindergarten of the German School and, one year later, the Arenas-Albéniz conservatory, where I had piano lessons with Purificación Padilla for ten years. I really enjoy playing the piano. Especially romantic composers like Chopin or Mendelssohn, but also Bach, Beethoven and more modern ones. I've won prizes in various music competitions (also with my little sister Camille, who plays the chello), even managing to become a national price holder of Jugend Musiziert.

My school has an enjoyable ambience, an open architecture and is equiped modernly, but sometimes lessons could go forward faster. I generally prefer the STEM subjects like MINT, which is a mix of everything focussed on letting us plan and develop our own projects, physics and maths (I won many prizes in mathematics competitions).

In my free time (after finishing my homework and hours playing the piano) I go swimming, which isn't very interesting but at least good for the body. I also spend some time reading, mainly fantasy books written by authors like Colfer, Funke, Tolkien and Zafón, but also classic ones from Dumas or London. In addition to that I like to be with my dog Baloo or the cats Max and Moritz.
I recently discovered the computer science, which is fascinating for its multiple ways to be aplied and its growing importance. I'm currently exploring a bit its fields, which made me create this website.
